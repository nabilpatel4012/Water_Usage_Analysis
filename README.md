# Water_Usage_Analysis
Water wastage is a worldwide issue. It needs constant monitoring to avoid water waste. One of the reasons for this is that the public and administrationare oblivious of what is going on. There are several types of water monitoring systems available, but they all require manual operation. The proper management of water is the focus of this project. The project's goal is to create a smart system for water discharge management and monitoring. The system is controlled by Arduino and allows water to flow out of the pipe in a regulated manner.The quantity of water 'q' to be released and the time 't' to perform this duty must be input into the system through a keypad and shown on the LCD screen coupled to Arduino at the transmitter end. The data is wirelessly delivered to the Arduino, which is located at the receiving end, using XBee. The information obtained is compared to the code written in Arduino programming. The waterflow sensor is connected to the Arduino, and the needed amount of water is forced to flow through the pipe according to the code. This project has effectively solved the problem of water discharge regulation.

## This is the Thinger Io dashboard.
## Guage Meter:
 This is the Meter which show the actual flow rate of water. The water flow rate is shown here in unit "L/min" which is "Literes/Minute".
## Progress Meter:
 This is the Bar where it shows the volume of water, that is how much water is used till now. This is displayed in "mls" which is "Milli Literes".
## Time Line Graph:
 This Graph just shows the actions of water flow Rate.
